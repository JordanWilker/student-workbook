What is the purpose of a Query String?

What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

1) The purpose of a query string is to easily transfer info to a url or server. The info is stuck to the end of the url and transferred to the api.

2)The format of a query parameter is key=value. They always start with the ?. They are separated by the &.

3) They would be very helpful for info simple passing. Instead of passing a whole line, you can pass a query parameter so to convey information.
