# Journal Week 5 Day 2

What are the three types of relationships?

What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding

What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

1) The three types of relations are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

2) The advantage of linking over embedding is how much easier to update info. If you embed, it is much harder to add new relationships.

3) One decision that is hard is if there is one of the manys that changes a lot and gets a lot of new things all the time, while the other one does not. Another challenge is does the many have different ones attached to it.
