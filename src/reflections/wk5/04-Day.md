What is a virtual property?

When might you use a virtual property?

How do you search by a virtual properties value?

1) A virtual property is a additional fields for a given model. One example is to add two fields together to make a new one.

2) Like stated in the above answer, you might want to use a virtual schema when you need to add two fields together. An example of this is adding the first name and last name together, to get the full name.

3) You cannot do that, you cannot search by a virtual properties value. You can only query a set value, not a virtual value.
