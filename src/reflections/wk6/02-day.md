What are props?

What are props used for?

Where can props be used or accessed?

1) A prop is the way that we pass information from one component or page to another. It is similar to passing variables in functions.

2) The props are used to convey information without having to delve deep into the information to get it everytime to access it. It is just a shortened and condensed way of passing info.

3) You can access props in the script tag by setting them equal to something, generally an object. You can get their infomation in the template by calling in the prop and then the data.
