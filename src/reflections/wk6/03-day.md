What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

1) Lifecycle hooks are a deeper look into library. They are used to tell you when something is created, deleted or changed.

2) I have used them in my projects mainly through the on mounted. It says, whenever this page loads, I want you to load this info, even if it hasn't changed.

3) The mounting hooks are the hooks that are used right before or after the page is loaded. If you want to do something right before a page loads, you would use a beforeMounted.
