```

**2.** In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

The term stands for make directory. It is used to make new files in the folder you are in.
```

**3.** What is the `\<html>\</html>` tag in a document?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The tag is for everything in the document. Everything but the doctype goes in the HTML tag.
```

**4.** What does `HTML` stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the skeleton of the website.
```

**5.** What Does `CSS` stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is generally used for making the sites look better.
```

**6.** What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:
```css
 h1.main-title {
   color : rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
 }
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
First in the rule is the selector. This is how you call it in your HTML. Next is the property, which is telling the code what you want to change. The last part is the value, and this is where you tell the code what to change it to after telling it what to change.
```

**7.** What property would you change if you wanted to make a font **Bold**?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
You would change the text property. You would change the value to bold.
```

**8.** In what tag does the majority of your code belong?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Most of your code belongs in the body tag. You have the head tag, and taht is where you import all the info, but the majority of the code you write will be in the body tag.
```

**9.** What three tags can be used to make lists (not list items)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The three types of lists that I found were the ordered lists, the unordered lists, and the descriptive lists. Unordered lists often just have bulletpoints, while ordered lists have numbers on the list, and descriptive lists have an item, and then another item to describe it.
```

**10.** Define the display `:flex property:`
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The property flex is used to make the site better by letting the parents decide how to space the children inside of them. Instead of just having everything in a line down, if you use flex, you can make it so that some elements are next to each other.
```

**11.** What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The two main properties that affect the size of a box model are width and height. You can measure them in many different units, and some common ones are px, % and vh and vw.
```
