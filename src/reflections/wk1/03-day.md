# Journal Day 3

What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?


1) I think the best tip that I have found so far is to get a very base design first. Get the colors and the basic columns first, and then worry about adding the images and the text.

2) I think some good resources to look at while analyzing the good design are the sites that look good on mobile and on the desktop. See how they lined everything up, and see what they chose to leave side by side and see what the decided to pile on top of eachother.

3) If you are selling a product, one thing that good design conveys is effort and investment. If the site has good design, you can tell that the seller is putting in effort to sell a product, and they are willing to invest time and money into their business.
