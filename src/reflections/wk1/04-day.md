# Journal Day 4 Week 1

What is the purpose of wire-framing?

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

1) The purpose of wireframing is to get a set feel and look for the site, so you can start coding with that in mind. It is better than just aimlessly coding and hoping something feels good.

2) The different levels of wireframing are anything from low fidelity all the way up to high fidelity. Low fidelity can be anything from a couple sketchs, while high wireframing is going to a site, and mapping every little detail out.

3) Almost of the time, it is worth the effort. Unless you are doing something super simple, it is always worth it to plan out your build, even if it is just a sketch or two.
