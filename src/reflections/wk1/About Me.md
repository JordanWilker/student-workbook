# About Me Journal #1

## Who am I?

---

I was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. Growing up, my hobbies included, but were not limited to, Taekwondo, Pokemon, and ultimate frisbee.
---
After graduation high school, I took a break from school to just work. After about a year of that, I decided to try college again, but found that it just wasn't for me. After dropping out, I started working at the downtown YMCA in the youth department, where I still worked up to this, and will still be working about 3 hour a week in the morning.
---
I got an interest in coding after learning the basic amount so I could teach coding camps, and tried to teach myself, but that did not work, so after some research, I decided to sign up for this course.
