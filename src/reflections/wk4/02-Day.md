# Week 4 Day 2

What are the three states of a Promise?

How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

1) The three states are pending resolved and rejected.

2) You call in a promise at the start, and it completes when the promise has been loaded, and you tell it what to do if you succeed or fail.

3) Then is for the success of the promise, you tell the code what to do then when the promise comes back. The catch is for catching any failures.
