# Journal Day 3 Week 2

What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

1) There is console.log, which prints something to the console. You should use this to see if something is running properly. There is also the error messages on the console. You should use those to see where your code breaks.

2) The sources tab is what allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS. It can be helpful to let you see if you even linked the CSS to the document, so you don't spend like 15 minutes wondering why the background is not working.

3) You can use the debug feature. That way, you can see exactly when and where you code breaks.
