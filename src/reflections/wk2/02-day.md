What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

1) The three different types of functions are Function declaration, Function expression, and Arrow Function expression. Function declarations are able to be hoisted and called before they are made, while the other two are not, and the difference between expression and arrow expressiona is that arrows do not create their own this values.

2) Parameters are what you write in as what the function is able to receive. Arguements are what the computer takes from the parameters and enters it into the code.

3) Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions. That means it is a function that receives a function as an input, and gives a function as an output. One example of this is Array.Map.
