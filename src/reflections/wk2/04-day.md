How do you find answers when you are stuck?

From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

1) The benefits of making a plan is that you always have something to fall back on. If things are going terribly, you can step back and just look at what you need to do next.

2) Google. Google is your best friend. Most likely, someone has had the exact same problem as you, and someone helped them answer it.

3) That you need to be able to give up on solutions to find another way. This will help you not get stuck
