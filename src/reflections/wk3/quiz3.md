# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Abstraction is the hiding of stuff. Encapsulation is separating data to help organization. Inheritance is making sure stuff is getting the properties of it parents. Polymorphism is having a condition appearing in several different forms.
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
let property staff.name
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation is separating data to help organize.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single responsibility. This is meaning having a function only do one thing, instead of trying to cram it all in.
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is actual data. An instance of a class is telling the computer what should be inside that class.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A proxy is something that is made different every time. It is used in the MVC pattern.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
To lock the user out of data. It isn't perfect, but helps. 
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is to tell the service to do something and displaying data. It is like the person taking your order at a fast food restaurant.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The service runs the code. It does the meat of the work and runs the processes. 
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The model stores data, and helps make classes of a certain object.
```
