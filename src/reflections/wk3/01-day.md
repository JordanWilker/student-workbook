What problem does using exports solve?

How does export differ from export default?

What is a benefit of using the Module System?

1) The problem that exporting solves is the easy access to data from the user. If you only export what you want, you can prevent the user from accessing everything

2) Export default will automatically export the thing once imported, but if you just export, you have to tell it what to import when you do.

3) Like using exports, it helps block the user from accessing and changing information. Although it makes it harder to access, it is not impossible.
